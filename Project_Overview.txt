This project uses the included Android phone app to connect Bluetooth to Arduino Uno microprocessor.  Arduino uses simple sketch to controll a stepper motor.  Stepper motor moves elevator model car up and down model elevator hoistway. 

Includes LED lite on/off buttons.

The first-time the Android pairs with the the HC-05 module, the HC-05 requires a password;(1 2 3 4). After the initial pairing, password in not required again.

The Android app displays an elevator panel with various elevator controll buttons.  The 4 floor buttons are marked 1 - 4.  The floor buttons function as expected moving the cab up and stopping at each floor.  But the coding was not finished, so these floor buttons do not function to move the elevator cab down.  Instead, the Down button is used to move the elevator cab down. 

It would be great if somebody finishes coding these Floor buttons so they will move the cab downward.

Enjoy.
