This project uses a home-made elevator - hoistway about 18" tall and cab about 5" tall.

Uses an Arduino Uno microprocessor with the Blue Tooth HC-05 module.

Uses an Android App to move elevator up / down and stop at various levels w/in the hoistway.

The Android App connects the Android phone's Blue Tooth to Uno's blue-tooth module.  The App displays a BT Connect button on App's displaying anelevator panel w/ floor buttons, up/down/stop buttons, and 
LED lite on/off buttons.
