# Elevator-Android-BlueTooth-App

Android App using BT to operate a model elevator.   Use usb and install App onto phone.   Upload Arduino sketch for Arduino Uno.
Use the Fritzing layout for pin-outs and connections.  

I centered the shaft of the stepper motor onto the half-top of the 3-sided hoistway, with the cable from stepper motor connecting 
straight-down to the center of the elevator cab top.

Coding and elevator work great.  All the buttons work, but code needs to be finished so that the Elevaor floor buttons (1 - 4) will move the elevator downward.  Currently the floor buttons 1 - 4 only move the elevator up and stop at each floor.  Uses the elevator down button to move car downward and stop at each floor.
