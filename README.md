# Elevator-Android-BlueTooth-App

Android App using BT to operate a model elevator.   Use usb to install App onto phone.   Install Arduino sketch for Arduino Uno.
Use the Fritzing layout for pin-outs and connections.  

I centered the shaft of the stepper motor onto the half-top of the 3-sided hoistway, with the cable from stepper motor connecting 
straight-down to the center of the elevator cab top.

Code works great and all the buttons work, but code needs to be finished so that the Elevaor floor buttons (1 - 4) will move the 
elevator downward.  Now uses the levator down button to move car downward.
